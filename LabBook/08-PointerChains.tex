\section{Pointer Chains}
    \subsection*{Question}
        How would you implement a chain of pointers in C++?.

    \subsection*{Reflection}
        Pointer chains can be created using the \mintinline{cpp}{void*}
        data type, a generic memory address pointer.
        The downside is that to be properly used you have to know what is at the 
        indicated memory address. In order to get my implementation to function
        it required converting to a long int pointer, dereferencing then converting
        back to a void pointer.

\section{Saving}
    \subsection*{Question}
        Implement the \mintinline{cpp}{SaveGrid(const char filename[])} method. 
        This method will save the values of \mintinline{cpp}{m_grid} in a similar 
        format to that of the Grid1.txt file. 
        Please use another name for the output file 
        so that your Grid1.txt file is not overwritten.

    \subsection*{Test Data}
        Data was input from the \textit{Grid1.txt} file.

    \subsection*{Reflection}
        Since I created an overload of the streaming operator for the grid class 
        in the previous task, the \mintinline{cpp}{SaveGrid(const char filename[])} was very easy
        to implement as I could just open the file, then use the overloaded streaming operator to copy
        in the data.
